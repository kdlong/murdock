<h2>Membership Information </h2>
<p>Welcome to Mastersingers, the community chorus of the Upper Cumberlands! </p>
<h2>Rehearsals </h2>
<p>Rehearsals begin at 7:00 pm in room 101 of TTU's Bryan Fine Arts Building. Always bring a pencil and your music to each rehearsal. </p>
<h2>Attendance </h2>
<p>Attendance at all rehearsals is expected. According to the Mastersingers Bylaws, at least 80% of rehearsals must be attended for participation in concerts. If the absence policy is not met, the member may elect to demonstrate competency with the concert literature for the conductor. (For the fall term, 80% translates 12 rehearsals) </p>
<h2>Music </h2>
<p>Music is expensive! Members are responsible for the music assigned to them. Any notes or marks must be made in pencil. Compensation for lost or damaged music is expected. All music must be returned to the Librarian, David Murdock (528-1875 H or 372-3044 W) after each performance. Should it be necessary that you leave the group at any time, please return music to David. </p>
<h2>Folders </h2>
<p>Black folders to be used for concerts may be borrowed or purchased. David Murdock will assist you with this matter. </p>
<h2>Dues </h2>
<p>Dues are necessary to partially defray the cost of the music, conductor, accompanist, and other expenses. Dues for a semester are $35.00 per person or $50.00 per person for the full year. Dues per couple are $80.00 for the full year. Make your check payable to Mastersingers and give it to Brian O'Connor, Treasurer. TTU students who are enrolled in the Mastersingers as a class are not required to pay dues. If the requirement of paying use makes it impossible for you to participate in Mastersingers, you may submit a written request for a dues waiver to the Mastersingers Board of Directors. Requests may be mailed to Mastersingers at TTU PO Box 5045, Cookeville, TN 38505, or may be given to Mendy Richards, President. </p>
<h2>Concert Dress Policy </h2>
<h2>Women </h2>
<p>Women should wear a solid black, long opaque sleeved, floor length dress (or long sleeved black blouse with a long black skirt), black shoes and black hose. The hem should be no more than three to four inches from the floor. Slacks are not acceptable unless they are very full-legged and have the appearance of a skirt when one is standing. By allowing some flexibility, it is hoped that the dress code will not impose a financial burden for anyone; however, we do need to present as neat and uniform an appearance as possible. In order to maintain a professional appearance, please avoid frilly, lacy outfits. Please also limit jewelry to small earrings. (We request that no necklaces be visible). </p>
<h2>Men </h2>
<p>Men should wear a black tuxedo with white formal shirt, black bow tie, black cummerbund, black shoes, and black socks. Please avoid vests. </p>
<h2>Everyone </h2>
<p>Everyone should avoid perfumes, colognes, and accented hair spray, as they cause problems for persons with allergies. </p>
<p>Thank you for cooperation. We should look as good as we sound! </p>
