</span></h2>
<p>In January of 1978, eighteen singers from the Cookeville community 
joined together under the direction of Dr. David Urness to form the choral 
organization known as Mastersingers. Since that time, literally hundreds of 
singers have participated, with thousands of audience members enjoying the 
fruits of their labor.</p>
<p>Mastersingers, which now averages sixty members, continues to enrich the 
cultural life of the Upper Cumberland area with quality choral presentations 
which include something for everyone! The group reflects the diversity of the 
community it serves, both in terms of membership and programming. 
Robert Shaw, one the greatest conductors of our time said: &quot;A chorus reaches 
deep into community life, crosses all sorts of social and economic lines, and 
makes a contribution not only to a city's aesthetics, but also its humanity.&quot; </p>
<p>Mastersingers needs your help in order to continue its 
tradition of providing at least two free concerts each 
season for the community. We have appreciated your support in 
the past, and ask that you consider becoming an official patron 
of the group by joining the &quot;Mastercircle&quot;. Donors will be listed in the programs throughout 
the season. Any contribution you can make will be most appreciated. 
Thanks for your help! </p>
