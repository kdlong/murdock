<UL>

<li> I am available for help in his offices for much of the day, and often much
later in the day than you might believe.
Help can also be gotten from <em>any</em> member of the Physics Department.

<li> I plan to have special help sessions on Wednesdays, 7pm-8pm to go over
the lab procedure, solve some textbook problems and help with the assigned homework.  If you don't 
have a conflict, <em> be there</em>! 

<li> There are bound books on reserve in the library containing: (a) A large 
collection of past quizzes and exams
and their solutions (i.e. my answer keys) (b) Solved problems from the 
textbook.  Go to the reserve desk and ask for
Murdock's Exam or Problem book for Phys 2020. The past quizzes and exams may also be
viewed <a href="ph2020doc.html">on-line</a>.

<li> Students in need of "brushing up" on their knowledge of scientific 
calculators, basic algebra and trigonometry
are invited to print out a booklet I (DPM) wrote, which is 
<a href="http://iweb.tntech.edu/murdock/books/PreSci.pdf">available on-line</a>.
