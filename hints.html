<H1> Big Hints For This Week's Problems </H1>
<hr>

<p><b>1.</b> <em>Draw a picture before you do anything.</em>  Ignoring 
the forces on the pivot itself (they give no torque <em>about the pivot</em>), 
there are two downward forces on the beam: THe force from the person's weight 
and the weight of the pivot itself.

<p><b>2.</b> The forces on the wheel are applied at two different radii.  The angle "phi" in the torque formula is
90 degrees, since the forces pull tangentially.

<p><b>3.</b> There are two upward forces on the scaffold, namely the forces from the two vertical ropes.
Both of these are unknown althought problem only asks for one of them.  There are two 
downward forces, namely the force from the man's weight and the weight of the scaffold 
itself.  You need to use the condition for zero net torque; when setting this up,
it will be easiest to put the "axis" on one end of the scaffold.  (Then one of the rope 
forces will give zero torque.

<p><b>4.</b> Find the angular acceleration of the m-g-r, in units of rad/s<sup>2</sup>, just like last week. Find the
moment of inertia of the m-g-r using the formula for a uniform disk.  This will give you the torque
on the m-g-r.  Finally since you know the radius and the force is applied tangentially, you can find
the magnitude of the force.
