I started my research life in the general area of applying 
<EM>relativistic </EM> equations of motion for nucleons in nuclear 
scattering and structure.  My thesis work was done under 
<A HREF="http://physics.indiana.edu/~charlie/aboutme.html">
Charles Horowitz</A>, now at Indiana University.

A few years back I fell into the problem of the motion of electrons in 
two dimensions (in confining channels).  This topic is not as academic 
as it might seem, as there are now ways to combine 
semiconductor materials to form
structures which will restrict electron motion in this way, resulting 
in two-dimensional "quantum wires", so called because 
when the dimensions (widths) of these structures
are on the order of tens of nanometers, one
has a chance of
observing effects arising from the quantum mechanical aspects
of electron motion.

This work is done in collaboration with <A HREF=

Londergan</A>, Professor of Physics at IU.
