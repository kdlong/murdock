<UL>

<li> Dr. Murdock is available for help in his offices for much of the day, and often much
later in the day than you might believe.
Help can also be gotten from <em>any</em> member of the Physics Department.

<li> Dr. Murdock plans to have special help sessions on Mondays, 4pm-5pm to go over
the lab procedure, solve some textbook problems and help with the assigned homework.  If you don't 
have a conflict, <em> be there</em>!  The time after class (11pm-12noon) may also be used for such a session.

<li> There are bound books on reserve in the library containing: (a) A large 
collection of past quizzes and exams
and their solutions (i.e. my answer keys) (b) Solved problems from the 
textbook.  Go to the reserve desk and ask for
Murdock's Exam or Problem book for Phys 121.

<li> Answers to all the problems in the textbook will be posted on the 
bulletin board near room Br219 and are available on the web: <br>
[[ <a href="CJ5ans1.pdf">Chaps. 1-5</a> ]] [[ <a href="CJ5ans2.pdf">Chaps. 6-10</a> ]]
<br>[Adobe Acrobat req'd on computer]

<li> Dr. Semmes also has a book on reserve in the library 
wherein he gives solutions for a large number of the suggested problems
listed above.

<li> Students in need of "brushing up" on their knowledge of scientific calculators, basic algebra and trigonometry
are invited to print out a booklet I (DPM) wrote, which is 
<a href="http://iweb.tntech.edu/murdock/books/PreSci.pdf">available on-line</a>.  [Adobe Acrobat req'd on computer]
