<H2>Fall 2002</H2>


<B>Instructor:</B><br>


<A HREF="http://gemini.tntech.edu/~murdock/"> 
Dr. David Murdock </A>, Bruner 221, [372]-3044 (Office), E--Mail: 
murdock@tntech.edu



<P><B>Lectures:</B><br>

T Th  3:00pm -- 4:15 pm, Bruner 224. 



Laboratory exercises will be announced well 
in advance; when they occur,
they will go from 7pm to 9pm on Tuesday or Thursday and will
take place in one of the lab or computer rooms in Bruner Hall.  

<P><B> Office Hrs:</B><br>
Liberal. When not teaching, I am in my office most 
of the time from 10am--6pm weekdays, and
often at night from 8pm--10pm.  (See my highly entertaining animated 
<a href="http://iweb.tntech.edu/murdock/teaching.html">
teaching schedule</a>.) See me for help on 
the problem sets!  If the door is closed, please knock.



<P><B>The Course:</B><br>

Astr 1010 is an introductory astronomy course, emphasizing the way in which
the scientific method is applied to the study of the universe. It is a
<EM>non--technical</EM> course, entirely suitable for general 
education science requirements or any student interested in the 
subject matter; the mathematical level will be kept as
low as possible in showing how scientists have developed their
ideas about the universe.<br>

The purpose of the course is to give an appreciation for astronomy,
scientific method and the quantitative nature of science, and 
to give an understanding of the physical universe. 



<P><B> Text</B><br>
<em>Michael Seeds, Foundations of Astronomy</em>, 7<sup>th</sup> ed.


<P><B>Prerequisites:</B><br>
Rudimentary high school algebra and geometry. (No logarithms or
trigonometry should be necessary.) Previous introduction to the natural
sciences will be helpful. 



<P><B>Other requirements:</B><br>
Students will be required to use a <EM>scientific</EM> calculator to
study the course material, and for the exams. By ``scientific
calculator'' is meant one which can work with scientific notation and
has ``power'' and 10<sup>x</sup> functions. 
Generally, a calculator which has
the keys <B>sin</B>, <B>cos</B> and <B>tan</B> is satisfactory (although we
will not use these functions). It need not cost more than $12 and 
can be purchased in <A HREF="http://www.kmart.com">
stores where I buy my wardrobe</A>, i.e. those
whose names end in the syllable ``Mart'', or in them big office supply stores.


<P><B>Workload</B><br>


Two midterm tests and a final exam. Reports on laboratory
exercises.  Several problem sets will be assigned to be handed in, but
others will be only suggested with answers given later in class.  
We will not have a laboratory exercises every week, but they are 
a required portion of the course <em>for which you have 
registered</em> at the given time slot.  A ``make-up'' for a missed 
lab will only be considered for <em>important, last-minute 
emergencies</em>.

<P><B>Grading</B><br>


Grades will be based on the exams, with a 25%--25%--30% weight for them
(respectively) and 25% on lab reports and 10% on required problem sets.
Final grades will be based on the best ``curve'' I feel is 
justified, but I will guarantee <em>at least</em> the following 
grade scale for the total possible points: 

<P>F: 0-30 D: 31-50 C: 51-65 B: 66-85 A: 86-100


<P>Attendance is not required, but is 
strongly suggested since the exams
will cover the material which I discuss in 
class, and in places this
does not follow the order of the textbook.  Students are responsible for
knowing about all announcements made in class.



<P><B>Topics</B><br>



Topics for 1010 will include: The appearance and "motions" of the sky; 
the history of astronomy; gravity and planetary motion; what we know 
about the individual planets; other members of the solar system 
(excluding the Sum).


<P>Any student with a disability 
who requires special assistance is requested to contact 
the Disability Services Office in UC 112 before August 23.
