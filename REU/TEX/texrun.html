<h1>Running LaTeX</h1>

There is no universal way to <em>run</em> the LaTeX program (and view/print the
results) because the "front end" to the program will be different on different machines.

<h2>Editing</h2>

It helps to have a good editor when working with LaTeX files.  The best 
ones have some way of recognizing when you are working on LaTeX and 
will color-code the control words and equations so that you can see the structure
of your work and find errors before the compiling stage.  Some will even show how
the parentheses and brackets are paired thus avoiding errors from omission of these.

On Unix systems one can set up Emacs to so this sort of thing.  The PC editor Winedt
will do this. Commercial implementations of LaTeX come with their own editors and
will do this kind of color-coding.  (At least, PC-TeX does.)

Keep in mind that the editor can just provide <em>help</em>in fixing 
the mistakes and it does not show how the final document looks.

<h2>Running, Etc.</h2>

<p>After you edit you document with the text editor, there are two steps involved:

<ul>
<li> Run LaTeX to produce a .DVI file from the .TEX file 
<li> Run a program which will take the .DVI file and send 
the visual information to a screen or printer, or else produce another file (e.g. a
postscript file) which can be printed.
</ul>

On some setups you would type <b>latex</b> for the first step and 
<b>xdvi</b> or <b>dvips</b> for the second step. If you have a "GUI" setup it's simpler;
you just click on buttons to <b>LaTeX</b>, to <b>View</b> and to <b>Print</b>.

<h3> Using Your Campus's Computers</h3>

Your campus or department may have a UNIX or LINUX -based computer for general use.  Such
a computer probably has LaTeX on it!  Make up a simple LaTeX file, run <b>LaTeX</b> 
and <b>dvips</b> and see what you get!


<h3> On Your Own PC, For Free</h3>

You would basically do the same things with the (free) TeX package MikTeX, when running it in
the command-line mode. Some editors might give you buttons to push so that you can work in GUI mode.

<h3> On Your Own PC, With Commercial Software</h3>

Commercial software will give you a GUI environment and you will jush push the right
buttons to do the LaTex-ing, Viewing and Printing.
