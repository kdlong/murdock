<h1> LaTeX -- Resource for IUCF REU Program</h1>

<h2>What is LaTeX?</h2>

<p>LaTex is a system which produces high--quality <em>scientific</em> documents.
It is to be distinguished from a word processor in that it can do a 
<em>professional</em>--quality job in setting the equations, 
tables and figures along with the numbering of all the parts of the document (including
the equations.  It will do all of this if it is given the <em>commands</em> for
how to organize the document, but in general 
you will not see the final form of the document
as you are working on it. In this way TeX is similar to the HTML that I am 
typing at this very minute. It is a <em>plan</em> for the 
organization of the information that you have.  In the end,
the result will be
better than that of any common word processor.

But there is a price to pay.  The "document" you prepare is much like a computer
program and it is possible to make mistakes so that you have to correct them.

<p>


<h2>Why You Need LaTeX</h2>

If you are a 
professional in math, physics or engineering... or if you 
are anticipating becoming a professional in these 
fields you will need to communicate
your results and ideas to others. It is a 
<b>Good Thing</b> if the presentation of your material is organized and
easy to read.  Scientists need numbered equations in their 
documents;  they don't need funny fonts and creative formatting!

<p>It is also a Good Thing if the document plan you make up can be used on 
many different computer systems... not 
everybody runs Unix!  Not everyone runs Windows on a PC or uses a Mac.
Everyone should be able to view your work.  So it is also a Good 
Thing if the software used to process this document 
is universal and <em>stable</em> so that we don't have to 
worry about the different versions. And it would great if the software was FREE.

LaTeX satisfies all of these needs.  It has become universal language
among mathematicians and scientists and <em>you</em> need to learn it.


<h2>But I've heard That LaTeX Is Really Hard. It's Hard, Isn't It? </h2>

Not really. In fact, I made up this REU mini-course to deal with
the perception that LaTeX takes months to learn. 

<p>Yes, producing a big document 
like an illustrated book will take lots of time.  But to 
produce a simple document with
a few equations is not hard and you can do it 
with the examples I give here. Then (if you want)
you can work your way up to more complicated things.



<h2>A Quick Tour of LaTeX's Features</h2>

What I produced for the 
<a href="http://www.physics.indiana.edu/~reu/>"Indiana Cyclotron Facility REU</a> 
students is a LaTeX document 
which includes many of the features
you might want in an article or report.  To see the final product
--a PDF document-- you need to have the
Adobe Acrobat software (most computers in school environments do nowadays).

I also made up a document extolling the virtues of LaTeX.  
It's mostly text, but here it is:
