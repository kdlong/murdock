<h1>LaTeX Software</h1>



<h2> Free or nearly free software for LaTeX:</h2>

<ul>

<li> <b><a href="http://www.miktex.org">MikTeX</a></b>
<br> A free version of TeX for the PC.  The full download has <em>everything</em> 
and is very large.

<li> <b><a href="http://www.winedt.com">WinEdt</a></b>
<br> A good editor which is <em>great</em> to use with TeX files; 
it comes with a nice interface to the MikTeX system.  You can try 
the program for a while but to use it longer it costs $40.  
If you can afford it, this is a good program to have.

</ul>



<h2> Not-So-Free LaTeX</h2>

It is true that the basic Tex and LaTeX programs were made free to the world, 
but a few companies have issued the basic software along with their own programs for 
editing the files and viewing and printing the results, 
and for installing all the software. 
Don't look for academic pricing on these because most of 
the people who use LaTeX are <em>known</em> to be academic.
