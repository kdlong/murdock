<H1>Astr 1020: Introduction to Modern Astronomy II</H1>

<H2>Spring 2002</H2>


<B>Instructor:</B><br>


Dr. David Murdock, Bruner 221, [372]-3044 (Office), E--Mail: MURDOCK, 
www page: http://gemini.tntech.edu/~murdock/


<P><B>Lectures:</B><br>

T Th  3:00pm -- 4:20 pm, Bruner 224. (The room can be changed if
there demand for it and general agreement.)  I can take a 
4 minute break midway through the period if that suits everyone.<br>


Laboratory exercises will be announced well 
in advance; when they occur,
they will go from 7pm to 8:50pm on Tuesday and will
take place in one of the lab or computer rooms in Bruner Hall.


<P><B> Office Hrs:</B><br>
Liberal. When not teaching, I am in my office most 
of the time from 10am--6pm weekdays, and
often at night from 8pm--10pm.  See me for help on 
the problem sets!  If the door is closed (and the 
light is on!), please knock.



<P><B>The Course:</B><br>

Ph 162 is an introductory astronomy course, emphasizing the way in which
the scientific method is applied to the study of the universe. It is a
<EM>non--technical</EM> course, entirely suitable for general 
education science requirements or any student interested in the 
subject matter; the mathematical level will be kept as
low as possible in showing how scientists have developed their
ideas about the universe.<br>

The purpose of the course is to give an appreciation for astronomy,
scientific method and the quantitative nature of science, and 
to give an understanding of the physical universe. 



<P><B> Text</B><br>


Seeds, Foundations of Astronomy, 6<sup>th</sup> ed.


<P><B>Prerequisites:</B><br>
Rudimentary high school algebra and geometry. (No logarithms or
trigonometry should be necessary.) Previous introduction to the natural
sciences will be helpful. The material of Ph 162 will be distinct from
that covered in Phys 161, so the first semester of the course, though
helpful, is <EM>not</EM> a prerequisite.



<P><B>Other requirements:</B><br>
Students will be required to use a <EM>scientific</EM> calculator to
study the course material, and for the exams. By ``scientific
calculator'' is meant one which can work with scientific notation and
has ``power'' and 10<sup>x</sup> functions. 
Generally, a calculator which has
the keys <B>sin</B>, <B>cos</B> and <B>tan</B> is satisfactory (although we
will not use these functions). It need not cost more than $16 and 
can be purchased in any "office superstore" or in
the <A HREF="http://www.kmart.com">
stores where I buy my wardrobe</A>, i.e. those
whose names end in the syllable ``Mart''.


<P><B>Workload</B><br>


Two midterm tests and a final exam. Reports on laboratory
exercises.  Several problem sets will be assigned to be handed in, but
others will be only suggested with answers given later in class.  
We will not have a laboratory exercises every week, but they are 
a required portion of the course <em>for which you have 
registered</em> at the given time slot.  A ``make-up'' for a missed 
lab will only be considered for <em>important, last-minute 
emergencies</em>.

<P><B>Grading</B><br>


Grades will be based on the exams, with a 25%--25%--30% weight for them
(respectively) and 20% on lab reports and required problem sets.
Final grades will be based on the best ``curve'' I feel is 
justified, but I will guarantee <em>at least</em> the following 
grade scale for the total possible points: 

<P>F: 0-30 D: 31-50 C: 51-65 B: 66-85 A: 86-100


<P>Attendance is not required, but is 
strongly suggested since the exams
will cover the material which I discuss in 
class, and in places this
does not follow the order of the textbook.  Students are responsible for
knowing about all announcements made in class.



<P><B>Topics</B><br>



Topics for Astr 1020 will include: Light and telescopes; the sun; methods by
which information on the stars is obtained; the stars and their life
stories; the Milky Way and other galaxies; the ideas of cosmology.

Students with a
disability requiring accommodations should contact the Office of Disability
Services (ODS).  An Accommodation Request (AR) should be completed as soon
as possible, preferably by the end of the first week of the course.  The ODS
is located in the Roaden University Center, Room 112; phone 372-6119
