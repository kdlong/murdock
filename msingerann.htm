<h3>From our director:</h3>

<p align="center">August 19, 2005 </p>
<p>Dear Singers, </p>
<p>The Board members and I are preparing for another successful season of the Mastersingers. You are receiving this letter because you are either a current member of the chorus, a past member of the chorus and we want you back, or we have heard that you sing and wish you would consider becoming a new member of the chorus. This letter includes information about the chorus's upcoming season, rehearsal schedules, seminar on preserving the voice, membership information, ensemble audition information, contact information and information about the Mastersinger summer 2006 Paris Tour. </p>
<p><strong>The 2005-2006 Season </strong></p>
<p>The 2005-2006 season will include three concerts by the full chorus and three to four performances by the Ensemble. We will begin our year with the Mastersingers traditional Christmas Concert featuring music from multiple eras, styles and traditions. This years Christmas concert will continue this wonderful community tradition. The Ensemble is scheduled to perform the Christmas portion of <em>Messiah </em>by G.F. Handel in Cookeville and at the Pleasant Hill Community Church. This year's fundraiser will be something new for the chorus. We will perform a concert version of the Broadway Musical Thriller <em>Jekyll and Hyde </em> by Frank Wildhorn and Leslie Briscusse. If you are not familiar with this show, I am sure once you hear the music you will recognize many of its songs. The show includes “This is the Moment,” “Someone Like You,” “In His Eyes” and “Once Upon a Dream” some of which were recorded by Linda Eder, who starred in the original cast as Lucy. This fundraiser event should be a night to remember. In the spring, the Ensemble will present a concert during the season of Lent of a Passion and other pieces with Lenten texts. Later in the spring, the full chorus will present a concert in tribute to American composers and American music. This concert will later be performed on our Paris Tour. I am excited about the upcoming concert season and all that great music that we will get to experience together. </p>
<p><strong>Rehearsal Schedule </strong></p>
<p>Rehearsals will begin September 12 th on Monday from 7:00-9:00 in the TTU Bryan Fine Arts Building Rehearsal Hall, Room 101 in the basement. Rehearsals will continue each Monday night until December 5 th . One extra rehearsal, December 8 th 7:00-9:00, will be called to prepare for the Christmas Concert. We will begin again in 2006 on Monday January 9 th from 7:00-9:00 and continue each Monday night until April 24 th with an extra rehearsal on April 27 th from 7:00-9:00. If you are participating in the Paris trip we will have two additional rehearsals on May 15 th and 22 nd from 7:00-9:00. </p>
<p><strong>Seminar on Preserving the Voice </strong></p>
<p>We are offering a special event this year to kick-off our new season. The board has asked Dolly Davis to present a seminar on preserving the aging voice. Dr. Dolly Davis served the University of Tennessee as a voice instructor, director of the UT Singers and the Women's Chorale, and as an Interim Chair of the Department of Music. She recently retired after nearly thirty years of service to the University and music community of Knoxville. Dr. Davis will present this seminar on ways to preserve the voice on August 29 th from 7:00-9:00 in the TTU Bryan Fine Arts Building Rehearsal Hall, Room 101 in the basement. I hope many of you will join us for this fun and informative way to get started with the 2005-2006 Mastersinger season. </p>
<p><strong>Mastersingers Membership </strong></p>
<p>Membership in the Mastersingers is open to anyone who wishes to participate. There is no audition required. The organization collects dues from all members to help defray the cost to run the chorus. Dues for one year are $45.00 per person or $70.00 for a couple. Each member is responsible for obtaining his or her own concert attire. The men wear black tuxedos with black bow ties. The women wear solid black long sleeved dresses. More information about the concert dress will be distributed at the first rehearsals. </p>
<p><strong>Mastersingers Ensemble </strong></p>
<p>From the full chorus a smaller ensemble is selected by audition. We will hold auditions September 19 th from 9:00-10:00. Each person interested in auditioning should be prepared to sing “America” on his or her voice part. Music will be distributed at the September 12 th rehearsal. Current members of the Ensemble do not need to re-audition, but your presence is requested at this audition to determine a good blend of singers. The ensemble will begin rehearsals on September 26 th from 9:00-10:00 and continue each Monday night until December 5 th . Two additional rehearsals, Dec. 6 th from 7:00-9:00 and Dec. 13 th from 5:00-6:30, will be held in December to prepare for <em>Messiah </em>. </p>
<p><strong>Mastersingers in Paris </strong></p>
<p>Now the exciting news; the Paris Tour of 2006! We have been working over the summer with a travel/tour agent planning a singing tour of Paris and surrounding areas. We are working to secure a performance in Notre Dame Cathedral, La Madeline, The American Church in Paris along with other venues in nearby cities and countries. There is a possibility that we may also combine with another Community choir from Birmingham, AL for this trip. The trip will cost approximately $2,000.00 a person and will include, flights, transfers, tour buses, tour admissions, hotel and breakfast and dinner each day of travel. More details about the itinerary, payment schedules and exact costs will be distributed at the first rehearsal. All members, spouses, children and close friends of members are invited to take part in this opportunity. This trip will be a mountain top experience for our organization and all of its singers. </p>
<p>I hope that the information included in this letter will entice you to either continue to sing, renew your membership or begin a new membership with the Mastersingers.
